# KERAS---hyperparameter-tuner
in this repository demonstrates how to select optimal number for layers, neurons , learning rates and so on , to tuning using keras tuner
KerasTuner is an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search. Easily configure your search space with a define-by-run syntax, then leverage one of the available search algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values for your models. KerasTuner comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in, and is also designed to be easy for researchers to extend in order to experiment with new search algorithms.
